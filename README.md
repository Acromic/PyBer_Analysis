# PyBer_Analysis :taxi:

## Purpose

Using Python knowledge of Pandas,  I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Technologies

  * Python
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib

## Ride share summary data by city type.

## Results
  * More fares by urban cities.

  * Rural areas carry the biggest average fare per driver

  * Urban total fares more than double Rural and Suburban put together

## Summary
More drivers needed in urban cities have generated more money than both rural and suburban areas combined.
With shorter average fares, more fares are taken daily. The longer the distance travelled the total rides go down.
With shorter distances travelled and higher rides rates, Urban areas are the biggest opportunity for revenue.
